**Data Mining Project**

Overview:

This project showcases three fundamental data mining techniques applied on different datasets:
1) Decision Tree Classification
2) Clustering
3) Sentiment Analysis

The objective is to demonstrate understanding and application of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and text mining techniques.

**Project Structure:**

1) Decision_tree_classification/ — Applying Decision Tree Classifier on Financial dataset.
2) Clustering/ — Performing Clustering (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical) on Wholesale Customers dataset.
3) Sentiment_analysis/ — Conducting Sentiment Analysis on textual data from Corona virus tweets dataset.

Each section includes code, dataset (or link), and analysis reports.

**Techniques Used:**

1) Decision Tree Classification: Used for predicting categorical labels based on input features.
2) Clustering: Unsupervised grouping of data points based on feature similarity.
3) Sentiment Analysis: Natural Language Processing technique to classify text sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- NLTK (for sentiment analysis)

**Results:**

Each technique includes:

- Data preprocessing steps
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results (where applicable)
